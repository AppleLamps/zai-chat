## [​](https://docs.z.ai/guides/image/cogview-4\#overview)   Overview

CogView-4 is Z.AI’s first open-source text-to-image model. It has comprehensive improvements in semantic understanding, image generation quality, and the ability to generate both English and Chinese text. It supports bilingual input of any length in Chinese and English and can generate images of any resolution within a specified range.

### Achieved SOTA Performance at Release

DPG-Bench (Dense Prompt Graph Benchmark) is a benchmark for evaluating text-to-image generation models, focusing on the model’s performance in complex semantic alignment and instruction following.At the time of release, CogView-4 ranked first overall in the DPG-Bench benchmark test, achieving SOTA performance among open-source text-to-image models.![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1749449849627DPG-Bench.png?attname=DPG-Bench.png)

### Better Chinese Understanding and Generation

Technically, CogView-4 replaced the English-only T5 encoder with the bilingual GLM-4 encoder and trained the model using bilingual image-text data, enabling the model to handle bilingual prompts.CogView-4 supports Chinese and English prompts and is especially good at understanding and following Chinese prompts, greatly lowering the prompt threshold for users. It is the first open-source text-to-image model capable of generating Chinese characters in the images, making it particularly suitable for creative needs in advertising, short videos, and other fields.

### Any Resolution and Any-Length Prompts

CogView-4 implements a mixed training paradigm of text descriptions (captions) of any length and images of any resolution. The model supports input prompts of any length and can generate images at any resolution within the supported range. This not only provides users with more creative freedom but also improves training efficiency.

## Prompt

Close-up, commercial food photography, intense indoor lighting, extreme detail. A Christmas dinner table, a corner of the table where a long-haired orange tabby cat leans its head close to a plate, greedily sniffing the festive feast with an expression of pure delight. The table features roast chicken, plants, salad, champagne, and gold-rimmed porcelain tea sets. Afternoon sunlight bathes the cat’s profile in golden light, casting a soft glow over both the food and its fur. A Christmas tree adorns the background. The image emphasizes the texture of the food and the cat’s coat, featuring strong lighting and a warm, festive Christmas atmosphere.
